### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, my name is Matt Kirke. I have just completed the School of Code Bootcamp! I thoroughly enjoyed the 16 weeks of intense training developing my skills in:

-JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Next.js
- Supabase
- Express
- Vitest
- Figma

During my training, I embraced the power of teamwork and collaborative coding through pair programming which strengthened my technical skills due to the dynamic learning environment and sharing of knowledge.



My journey has not only been about learning languages and frameworks but also about developing a mindset geared towards problem-solving and effective communication.
